Windows 11 ushers in the age of generative artificial intelligence (AI) on the desktop. Copilot, the company's new AI system, assists with many tasks, from summarizing documents to writing cover letters to creating unique images. Microsoft has even added a Copilot key on the PC keyboard and markets a new line of Windows PCs under the Copilot+ banner. The AI updates follow in the bold new look of Windows, with its centered Taskbar, rounded window corners, and translucent textures. Despite these interface changes, using Windows 11 doesn't feel drastically different from using Windows 10, and the newer OS still runs the same applications. Overall, Windows 11 is an Editors' Choice winner for operating systems, alongside Apple's polished macOS Sequoia.

For the 2024 update of Windows 11, otherwise known as version 24H2 (meaning 2024, second half), Microsoft rebuilt much of the underlying kernel code for better performance and security. Rather than exciting new features, we see some helpful interface tweaks, like the ability to scroll the Quick Actions panel for more settings and a redesigned Copilot that no longer plants itself on the right side of your screen. It also adds updates to File Explorer and improves the Phone Link features.
But the biggest changes come for Copilot+ PCs, which can now run on long-battery-life Qualcomm Snapdragon CPUs or those from Intel and AMD. Those NPU-equipped devices get new AI-powered features like Click to Do, Super Resolution in the Photos app, natural-language search in OS components, and generative Erase and Fill in the Paint app.
The newest version isn't the end of updates. Microsoft adds new features in what it calls "continuous innovation." In other words, in addition to an annual big update, you get new features and changes throughout the year.
