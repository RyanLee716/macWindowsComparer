Although I use both a Windows and Mac machine for work, I turn to the latter when I'm off the clock. Sequoia further cements macOS as my choice for personal computing. The latest OS update looks elegant, runs smoothly, is very enjoyable to use, and builds on Appleâ€™s long tradition of seamless cross-platform compatibility with the iPhone Mirroring feature. The excellent Passwords app and a bunch of small tweaks also outweigh a couple of continuing frustrations with core features. Accordingly, macOS Sequoia is an Editors' Choice winner for desktop operating systems along with Windows 11.
