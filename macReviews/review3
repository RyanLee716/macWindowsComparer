Does a macOS update without a headlining feature still feel like a macOS update? The answer is: mostly yes! Which should encourage even those of you who are deeply skeptical of Apple Intelligence and other generative AI features that it's an update worth installing.

I do often find that I take a shine to the new flagship features of a given macOS updateâ€”I don't use a ton of the widgets from Sonoma, but the ones I do use are always present and quietly useful; I use Dark Mode from Mojave basically by default; I have a couple of Shortcuts from Monterey that I would hate to give up. But by and large I find my favorite macOS additions are off to the side of the flagship additions, or buried in some obscure corner. Sequoia has just as much of those features as any other macOS release in the last 15 years.

But the not-done-ness of Apple Intelligence means the version of Sequoia everyone is using six months from now won't really be the same operating system we're looking at today. Look for separate deep dives (and extensive after-the-fact additions to this review) as those features finally make their way to the public.
