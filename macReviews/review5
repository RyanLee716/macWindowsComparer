After spending a few months with macOS Sequoia, I have to say I like it quite a bit. I think the upgrades it delivers are subtle but useful, and they all add valuable functionality without detracting from the experience of using a Mac.

However, what I'm really excited for is Apple Intelligence. Apple is late to the AI craze currently sweeping the tech industry, and I'm eager to see if that more cautious approach results in more useful, more capable AI features when they finally do arrive in macOS Sequoia.

Unfortunately, until they do I'm afraid Sequoia is a pretty straightforward update that nobody should feel compelled to rush out and download. The upgrades I've seen so far are nice to have, but the main attraction is still MIA. So update to Sequoia if you can, but be readyâ€”we still haven't seen what AI will do to macOS.
